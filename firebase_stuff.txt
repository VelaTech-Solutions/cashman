? Which Firebase features do you want to set up for this directory? Press Space to select 
features, then Enter to confirm your choices. Functions: Configure a Cloud Functions directory
 and its files, App Hosting: Configure an apphosting.yaml file for App Hosting, Hosting: 
Configure files for Firebase Hosting and (optionally) set up GitHub Action deploys, Storage: 
Configure a security rules file for Cloud Storage, Emulators: Set up local emulators for 
Firebase products

=== Project Setup

First, let's associate this project directory with a Firebase project.
You can create multiple project aliases by running firebase use --add, 
but for now we'll just set up a default project.

? Please select an option: Use an existing project
? Select a default Firebase project for this directory: cashman-790ad (cashman)
i  Using project cashman-790ad (cashman)

=== Functions Setup
Let's create a new codebase for your functions.
A directory corresponding to the codebase will be created in your project
with sample code pre-configured.

See https://firebase.google.com/docs/functions/organize-functions for
more information on organizing your functions using codebases.

Functions can be deployed with firebase deploy.
