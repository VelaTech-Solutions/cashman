# Extract Statement Button: This function is working well.
# View Raw Extracted Data: Also functioning as expected.
# Add/Edit/Remove Line and View Removed Lines: You plan to allow users to highlight specific words or sentences from extracted data for removal. This will involve:
# Setting up front-end interactions for highlighting and selecting text.
# Creating back-end logic to process these selections and remove the lines.
# Re-running the extraction function to reflect the cleaned data.
# API Integration: You need to set up the communication between the front-end and back-end to handle these interactions.

# Sure, hereâ€™s your to-do list with the two app ideas we discussed:

# Language Learning App with AI/VR Integration

# An interactive app that helps users learn a new language in a fun, engaging way.
# Combines mother tongue explanations with random, spontaneous phrases for better retention.
# Future integration: Use VR for immersive language experiences.
# Voice-Controlled Software Builder

# An AI-powered tool where users can verbally describe software requirements.
# The system builds components, generates code (Python, JavaScript, etc.), and runs the app with results automatically.
# These ideas are now captured! Let me know if you want to expand or prioritize them further. ðŸ˜Š
